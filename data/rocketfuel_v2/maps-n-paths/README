a note on deciphering the policy-dist.tar.gz file

'tar zxvf policy-dist.tar.gz' creates a top-level directory called
maps-n-paths. this file is contained in that directory.

maps-n-paths will have sub-directories of the form "x:y". 

when x=y:
	this directory contains the internal topology of the ISP with
	AS number = x.	the following files should be in directory.
	
	1. edges: the topology itself (the number at the end of each
	edge is the number of times that edges was observed in out
	traceroutes).

	2. edges.lat: the edges along with their (geographical)
	latency in milliseconds.

	3. edges.wt: the edges along with their inferred weights.

when x!=y
	this directory contains the edges observed between the two
	ISPs with AS numbers x and y. two files in each such
	directory.

	1. edges: the peering edges between the two ISPs along with
	the number of times they were observed in our traces.

	2. edges.lat: the edges along with their (geographical)
	latency in milliseconds. this should be zero in most cases,
	but it is non-zero when the two ISPs use different city names
	at the two ends of the link.
