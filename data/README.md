## co_topology.dat

Network topology for CO level network

````python
<node-count> <edge-count>
# for each node in (0, node-count]
<node-id> <co2/kWh> <0/1> # last field indicate availability of renewable energy
# for each edge in (0, edge-count]
<edge-u> <edge-v> <latency> <capacity in mbps>
````

## init_topology.dat

Initial topology for the entire newtwork, i.e., inter-CO and intra-CO. This file is generated by running `process_topology.o`. 

````python
<co-count>
# for each co in (0, co-count]
... <reneable-energy in kW> ... # 24 data points
<node-count> <edge-count> # for the entire network
# for each node in (0, node-count]
<node-id> <co-id> <'c'/'s'> <sleep-energy> <base-energy> <per-cpu-energy> <cpu-count> 
# c: compute/server, s: switch, last two data are for servers
# for each edge in (0, edge-count]
<node-id> <node-id> <'b'/'i'> <link-cap> <link-delay> 
# b: backbone edge, i: intra-CO edge
````

## vnf_types.dat

Information about VNF types and flavors

````python
<type-count>
# for each type in (0, type-count]
<type-id> <type-name>
<flavor-count>
# for each flavor in (0, flavor-count]
<flavor-id> <type-id> <cpu-core> <processing-delay>
````

## timeslots.dat

Contains SFC request specification for timeslots

````python
<total-sfc-count>
<timeslot-count>
# must insert dummy timeslots (containing zero sfcs) to represent timeslots by which time all active sfcs will expire.
#for each timeslot in (0, timeslot-count]

## greencap.dat

This file contains random data representing renewable energy generated at different locations. The `green_shuffle.py` program is used to shuffle this file before an experiment is run.
