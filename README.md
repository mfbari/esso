## Source code for the 'Energy Smart SFC Orchestrator (ESSO)' paper
---
Follow the instructions in the `run_simulation` notebook to run a simulation. 

Directory structure:
* `src` directory contains source code for both optimal and heuristic solutions
* `data` directory contains the datasets
  * Each data directory **must** contain the following files before running a simulation.
  *File formats are defined in [file-info](data/file-info) 
    * `co_topology.dat`: contains the overall (inter-NFV-POD) topology, CO2 emission, amount of available renewable energy of all COs/NFV-PODs. File format explained [here](data/file-info/co_topology.info).
    * `timeslots.dat`: contains SFC arrival events distributed over timeslots. File format explained [here](data/file-info/timeslots.info).
    * `vnf_types.dat`: contains information about the VNF types. The `flavor-id` listed in this file is referenced from `timeslots.dat` File format explained [here](data/file-info/vnf_types.info).
    * `init_topology`: this file is generated by running `process_topology` (more on this in the notebook)
* `run` directory conatins files and directories generated during a simulation (additional details in the notebook)
* `./run_simulation.py` with command line options
3. Results are stored under the dir `runs`
